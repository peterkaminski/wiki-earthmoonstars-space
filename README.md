# Earth Moon Stars Space Project Wiki

**Earth Moon Stars Space** (EMSS) is an independent, autonomous organization whose main activity is publication of the [[Earth Moon Stars Space]] (mockup) art journal.

The project is currently in Prototype Phase. If [[Health Metrics]] for the Prototype reach acceptable levels, it will move into Production Phase.

This wiki is used for management of the project.

The project owns itself and the [[Project Assets]]. You can read about the [[Project Finances and Business Model]]. There is a [[Project Ledger]] which tracks contributions.

The project is governed and stewarded by the [[Stewardship Committee]]. Governance voting rights are dynamic and proportional to project contributions to date.

The [[Editorial Committee]] is responsible for setting [[Contribution Standards]], for defining and maintaining the tone and quality of the art journal, and for setting the [[Publication Calendar]].

People contribute to the project in various [[Project Roles]].

We track issues and tasks with [[Project Management]].
