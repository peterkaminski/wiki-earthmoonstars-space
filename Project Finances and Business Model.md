# Project Finances and Business Model

The project's business model is focused on generating high-quality stories and community around them. It is chartered to maximize social good, and not to maximize profit.  It strives to be distributive, not extractive.

The project strives to be generally cash neutral, with a small amount of fiat currency reserves held for important immediate expenses.

Subscriber fees are paid to Peter Kaminski. The project does not yet have a favorable tax stance, so one of the expense are expected personal taxes paid by Peter Kaminski.

The primary expense is the Ghost server.

Each month, income from subscriber fees is allocated first to expenses, then a percentage (currently 50%) is held by Peter Kaminski for fiat currency reserves. Any remaining profit is paid to contributors per proportional contribution share to date.
