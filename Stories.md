# Stories

Stories are the primary output of the project. They are narratives, poems, or other text, created by Contributors, and enjoyed by Subscribers (see [[Project Roles]]).

Non-story project contributions are also notionally denominated in "stories", and the denomination is also used in proportional governance (see [[Stewardship Committee]]) and profit-sharing (see [[Project Finances and Business Model]]).

For more information about stories, see [[Contribution Standards]].
