# Contribution Standards

In the following, "stories" include both the text and images of a story.

- ~100-200-word fiction stories, poems, etc.
- strive for originality, thoughtfulness, morality, philosophical depth
- avoid: triteness, banality
- avoid: stories which glorify violence, domination, subjagation, etc.
- “semi-professional” quality–stories don't have to be perfect, but should be pretty good, and will only be published at the discretion of the [[Editorial Committee]]
- each story has at least one image. images should not be square (square AI-generated images are trite); landscape-aspect images of at least 4:3 width fit the format best. minimum height should be 512 pixels. (512 height * 4 / 3 aspect = 683 width)
-  stories and images may be generated with the help of AI text and image synthesis, and if used, engine(s) must be specified
- image prompts must not use the name of any living artist
- images must include very descriptive and accurate alt text, suitable to explain the image to a blind person (consider that generic AI-generated image description may not be descriptive enough)
- images should not include jarring physical or geometry inconsistencies (AI image glitches are trite)
- images should not be icky, gross, cause revulsion, etc., including but not limited to possible trypophobia triggers (CONTENT WARNING, consider disabling image display in your web browser before searching for "trypophobia" in case you are trypophobic, search for "how do i disable images in my web browser?")
-  stories do not have to have a space or science fiction theme, the "Earth Moon Stars Space" name is meant to be a whimsy, not a genre definition

# What moral responsibilities should an author uphold?

_The following was generated by ChatGPT May 3 (2023) Version, GPT-3.5. Consider the following as part of the Contribution Standards until they are updated by the Editorial Committee._

As an author, there are several moral responsibilities that one should uphold. Here are a few key ones:

1.  Accuracy and truthfulness: An author should ensure that the facts and information presented in their work are accurate and truthful. Misrepresenting or distorting facts can mislead readers and undermine the credibility of the author.
2.  Respect for diversity: An author should respect and celebrate diversity in all its forms, including race, gender, sexuality, religion, and culture. Portraying characters or communities in stereotypical or derogatory ways can perpetuate harmful biases and perpetuate discrimination.
3.  Ethical treatment of subjects: An author should treat the subjects of their work with respect and empathy, whether they are real individuals or fictional characters. This includes avoiding gratuitous depictions of violence or harm and respecting the privacy and dignity of real individuals.
4.  Responsibility for impact: An author should consider the potential impact of their work on readers and society as a whole. This includes being mindful of how their work might be received by different audiences and taking steps to address any unintended negative consequences.
5.  Intellectual honesty: An author should be intellectually honest and transparent in their work. This includes acknowledging sources and influences, being open to feedback and criticism, and avoiding plagiarism or other forms of academic dishonesty.

Overall, authors have a responsibility to create works that are truthful, respectful, and ethical. They should consider the impact of their work and strive to create content that is both meaningful and responsible.
