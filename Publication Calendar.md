# Publication Calendar

The [[Editorial Committee]] is responsible for the Publication Calendar.

Publication Calendar is not yet specified in the Prototype Phase.

In the Production Phase, it may be biweekly, twice a month, weekly, etc.

We note that special issues (e.g., on particular holidays or during particular season, double issues once or twice a year) can add variety and interest to the publication.
