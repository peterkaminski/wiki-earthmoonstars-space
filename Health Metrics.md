# Health Metrics

We monitor and try to improve these metrics, as proxies for overall project health.

- Publication frequency: at least 2x per calendar month.
- Stories per issue: at least 8-10 per issue
- Contributors: at least 3-4 per issue
- Active contributors, have contributed in the last few months and will contribute again: at least 10
- Subscribers: at least 20, around half paying
- Stewards: at least 3
- Editors: at least 2

We are currently in prototype phase, so the metrics are in flux, but our goal is to reach about 50% health before moving to production phase.
