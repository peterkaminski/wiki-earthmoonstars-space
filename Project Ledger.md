# Project Ledger

The Project Ledger is where we track contributions for governance and stewardship (see [[Stewardship Committee]]) and profit sharing (see [[Project Finances and Business Model]]).

It is held in an Airtable base to which Contributors and the Stewardship Committee have access.

Contact Pete to gain access.
