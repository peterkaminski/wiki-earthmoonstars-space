# Stewardship Committee

The Stewardship Committee makes decisons about the project. Governance voting rights are dynamic and proportional to project contributions to date.

Project contributions are denominated in [[Stories]].

Stewards are volunteers who have contributed to the project, and who have been accepted onto the Stewardship Committee by simple majority vote. They may be removed from the  Stewardship Committee by two-thirds supermajority vote (excluding their voting shares).

To determine the number of voting shares, sum the current contributions (either stories directly, or story-denominated non-story contributions) for each individual or organizational participant. Each participant's voting shares are the number of stories they have contributed, divided by the total number of contributions.

Typical decisions require a simple majority to pass, with the Founder or Founders breaking ties.

Decisions which alter the governance structure or organization structure require a two-thirds supermajority to pass.
